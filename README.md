Event Volunteer Scheduling System is a Java console-based application developed using JDBC and Oracle Database to manage event volunteers efficiently. 
The system allows registration of volunteers, creation of event shifts, and assignment of volunteers to shifts with proper validation and constraint handling. 
It prevents duplicate registrations, avoids overlapping shift assignments, and ensures data integrity using primary key, foreign key, and unique constraints. 
The project follows an MVC-based structure with clear separation of beans, services, DAO, and utility layers, demonstrating strong database integration and exception handling in Java.
